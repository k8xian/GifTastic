**Deployment:** [giphtastic-k8xian.herokuapp.com](https://giphtastic-k8xian.herokuapp.com/)

## instructions
* click on one of the buttons to generate gifs on that topic
* you can also generate gifs for any topic by typing into the text box and clicking submit
* click on the gif to animate it, and again to stop it

## development
* The gifs are generated from the giphy api https://giphy.com
* According to ALL the documentation I found, adding 'download' or 'download="' is supposed to make something  downloadable, but I'm having trouble getting this to work. I think it might be related to the source of the content, I'm not sure how to resolve in conjunction with an API
